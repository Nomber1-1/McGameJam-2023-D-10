McGameJam 2023 Project - D-10

Hi!

This was the project we worked on as a part of Team #26 - Space Ninjas for the 2023 McGameJam!

The theme of the 2023 McGameJam was "desert/deserted" which we interpreted with our space horror game D-10. 

Left deserted on a space station with little to no air, will you be able to escape before time runs out?

Good luck and we hope you enjoy our game!

**D-10 was made in collaboration with:**

- Tavio Ficaccio - Programming (Typing Mini-game)

- Joel Boyer - Particles Effects
