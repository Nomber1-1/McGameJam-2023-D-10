McGameJam 2023 Project - D-10

Hi!

This was the project I worked as a part of team #26 - Space Ninjas for the 2023 McGameJam!
The theme of the 2023 GameJam was "desert" which we interpreted with our space horror game D-10. Will you be able to escape before time runs out?

Good luck and I hope you enjoy our game!

**D-10 was made in collaboration with:**

- Tavio Ficaccio - Programming (Typing Mini-game)

- Joel Boyer - Partical Effects

- Ana Gordon - Programming (Player-Object Interaction)

- Aerin Brown - Programming (Player Movement) and Sound Design

- Fabian Saldana - 3D Modeling

- Patrick Zakaria - Level Design and Animations

- Tarek Namani - 3D Modeling and Lighting


**Game Engine:** Unity

**Programming Language:** C#
